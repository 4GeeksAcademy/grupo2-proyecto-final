            <p>
              Mov+ collects information you provide, automatic information related to your use of the service, partner information, and data from other sources.
            </p>

              We use the information to personalize content recommendations, provide the service, respond to inquiries, coordinate with partners, improve our service, and communicate with you.
            </p>

            <h3>Information Disclosure:</h3>

              We share information with affiliated companies, service providers, partners, and in specific circumstances, such as legal compliance or business sales.
            </p>

            <h3>Account Access and Profiles:</h3>
            <p>
              We offer features like "Remember Me" and user profiles. Profiles allow for a personalized experience, but note that others with access to your account can view and modify these profiles.
            </p>

            <h3>Email and Text Messages</h3>
            <p>
              If you no longer wish to receive certain communications from us via email or text message, simply go to the communication settings options in the "Account" section of our website and uncheck the corresponding box to stop receiving emails. Alternatively, click the "Unsubscribe" link in the email or reply STOP (or as instructed) to the text message. Please note that you may not be able to stop receiving certain types of service-related correspondence, such as account transaction messages.
            </p>

            <h3>Automatic Notifications</h3>
            <p>
              You can choose to receive automatic mobile notifications from Mov+. In certain operating systems, you may be automatically enrolled in notifications. If you later decide that you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device's settings to disable them. We also offer automatic notifications in certain web browsers. If you agree to receive these notifications and later decide that you no longer wish to receive them, you can use your browser's settings to disable them.
            </p>

            <h3>Identifier Matching Communications</h3>
            <p>
              Some third-party sites and apps allow us to send our users online promotions about our titles and services by sending a privacy protection identifier to the third party. The privacy protection identifier indicates that we convert the original information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value to prevent the disclosure of such information. The third party compares the privacy protection identifier to the identifiers in its database, and a match is established only if you used the same identifier (such as an email address) with both Mov+ and the third party. If there is a match, Mov+ may choose to send you a specific promotional communication through that third-party app or site, and it can better optimize and measure the effectiveness of online advertising. In the "Marketing Communications" section of the "Account" page on our website, you can choose to stop receiving messages.
            </p>

            <h3>Behavioral Advertising</h3>
            <p>
              Behavioral ads are those selected based on the use and/or interactions on unrelated third-party websites and apps on the internet (behavioral advertising). Mov+ may advertise its services through behavioral advertising, and if you use a browser, some cookies and web visit counters allow us to collect information that helps identify your likely interests. If you use a mobile device, tablet, or media player that includes a reconfigurable device identifier, such identifier is used to identify your likely interests.
